This project, developed as our Final Year Project (FYP) at PIEAS, is an IoT-based Industrial Monitoring and Control System 🏭. The system includes three tanks: two upper supporting tanks and one lower monitoring tank. The supporting tanks hold chemicals, which are pumped into the monitoring tank using pumps controlled by relays ⚙️, all interfaced with an ESP8266 microcontroller 📡.

Real-time monitoring 🕒 is achieved through strategically placed sensors, including pH sensors, air quality sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and an RGB color sensor 📊. These sensors automate the mixing process based on real-time feedback 📈. For example, when the pH and RGB sensors detect the desired chemical levels, the system halts the process ⛔ and safely discharges the mixture 🚰.

This system showcases the practical application of Industry 4.0 🏗️ and Industrial IoT (IIoT) 🌐 principles, improving automation, reducing human intervention, and ensuring energy efficiency ⚡. With IoT technology, it represents a modern approach to solving industrial challenges, making processes more efficient and reliable.
